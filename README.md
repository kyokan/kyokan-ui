## Philosophies

  * "depend on our own API"
* Glen Maddern: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu4U7lwZTRI
  * build around your own desired API
  * using `styled-components` gives us all the power of JavaScript while solving the issue of global styles from CSS and the arbitrary class names from CSS modules

  * "[best practices] are completely useless if they're not enforced"
  * no one is going to adhere to best practice that block you from getting things done
